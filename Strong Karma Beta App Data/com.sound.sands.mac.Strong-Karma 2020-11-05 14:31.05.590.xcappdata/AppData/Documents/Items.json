I never got deep enough to get into emotional territory. Nonetheless I have some level of samadhi.\n\nI notice my ideas of reference have become constant little reminders for everything to make ultimate sense even path pointers, reminders of god, and a god that has personally decided to intervene in my life in tiny ways perceptible only to me. I remember the awakening experience eliminated most of this behavior. I only responded to big items like my wife needed my attention, it was hers. But not, that car horn honks it means I should call Billy. \n\nThese conflations of different sense perception into meaning globules came to me prior to meditating when my son was talking about Spider-Man. In a metaphorical sense, this power (improperly used though it may be) is the power\/curse I got from Marijuana \n",
